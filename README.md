# PMR
Planar Movement Recognizer. The Planar Movement Recognizer (PMR) library provides an easy and platform independent way to recognize planar movements (like mouse gestures).

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE!</b> From now on, the repository is the part of the NSTD library and thus moved there [https://github.com/Ptomaine/nstd]. All upcoming bug fixes and changes will happen to the NSTD library instead. So, you are encouraged to move there too.
